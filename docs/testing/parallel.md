# Parallel

By default, PHPUnit runs tests sequentially. This can be slow, especially if you
have a lot of tests. To speed up your test suite, you can run tests in parallel.
To get started, you'll need to install the `paratest` package:

```bash
composer require --dev brianium/paratest
```

You can then call the `vendor/bin/paratest` binary to run your tests in parallel:

```bash
vendor/bin/paratest
```

You should also update your `composer.json` file to include a script to run your
tests in parallel:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vendor/bin/paratest"
  }
}
```
