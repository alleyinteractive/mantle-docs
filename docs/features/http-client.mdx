# HTTP Client

## Introduction

Mantle provides a fluent and expressive wrapper around the [WordPress HTTP
API](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/http-api/) allowing you to quickly
make HTTP requests with external services. The HTTP Client combined with support
for [testing and faking Remote Requests](../testing/remote-requests.md) provides
you a full solution for making and testing external HTTP requests end-to-end.

## Making Requests

The HTTP Client is installed by default with Mantle. It also supports being used
outside of the framework.

<Tabs groupId="use-preference">
  <TabItem value="framework" label="Framework Use" default>

The Http Client is included with Mantle out of the box.

Making requests with the HTTP Client can be done using any HTTP verb. Requests
can be made using the `Http` facade class or by instantiating `Mantle\Http_Client\Http_Client`
directly:

```php
use Mantle\Facade\Http;

$response = Http::get( 'https://example.org/' );
```

You can also use other HTTP methods fluently on the `Http` facade:

```php
use Mantle\Facade\Http;

$response = Http::post( 'https://example.org/', [
  'name' => 'Mantle',
] );
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Standalone Use">

Install the Http Client package via Composer:

```bash
composer require mantle-framework/http-client
```

Making requests with the HTTP Client can be done using any HTTP verb. Requests
can be made by instantiating `Mantle\Http_Client\Factory` directly:

```php
use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

$http = new Factory();

$response = $http->get( 'https://example.org/' );

// Or using a fluent interface:
$response = $http
  ->timeout( 10 )
  ->get( 'https://example.org/' );
```

### Request Data

Many HTTP requests include some sort of a payload for `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`,
and `DELETE` methods. These methods access an array of data as their second
argument. By default these will be sent using JSON:

<Tabs groupId="use-preference">
  <TabItem value="framework" label="Framework Use" default>
    ```php
    use Mantle\Facade\Http;

    Http::post( 'http://example.org/endpoint', [
      'name' => 'Mantle',
    ] );
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Standalone Use">
    ```php
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

    Factory::create()->post( 'http://example.org/endpoint', [
      'name' => 'Mantle',
    ] );
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Sending a Body

Requests can also be made using a form body or a raw body:

<Tabs groupId="use-preference">
  <TabItem value="framework" label="Framework Use" default>
    ```php
    use Mantle\Facade\Http;

    Http::as_form()->post( 'http://example.org/endpoint', [
      'name' => 'Mantle',
    ] );

    Http::with_body( 'raw-body' )->post( 'http://example.org/endpoint' );
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Standalone Use">
    ```php
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

    Factory::create()->as_form()->post( 'http://example.org/endpoint', [
      'name' => 'Mantle',
    ] );

    Factory::create()->with_body( 'raw-body' )->post( 'http://example.org/endpoint' );
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### GET Request Query Parameters

When making `GET` requests, you can either pass a URL with a query string
directly or pass an array of key / value pairs as the second argument:

<Tabs groupId="use-preference">
  <TabItem value="framework" label="Framework Use" default>
    ```php
    use Mantle\Facade\Http;

    // The actual URL will be https://example.org/query?name=mantle
    Http::get( 'https://example.org/query', [
      'name' => 'mantle',
    ] );
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Standalone Use">
    ```php
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

    // The actual URL will be https://example.org/query?name=mantle
    Factory::create()->get( 'https://example.org/query', [
      'name' => 'mantle',
    ] );
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Headers

Headers can be added to a request using the `with_header()` and `with_headers()`
methods:

<Tabs groupId="use-preference">
  <TabItem value="framework" label="Framework Use" default>
    ```php
    Http::with_headers( [
      'X-Api-Key' => 'password',
    ] )->post( 'https://example.org' );

    Http::with_header( 'X-Special-Header', 'value' )->post( 'https://example.org' );
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Standalone Use">
    ```php
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

    Factory::create()->with_headers( [
      'X-Api-Key' => 'password',
    ] )->post( 'https://example.org' );

    Factory::create()->with_header( 'X-Special-Header', 'value' )->post( 'https://example.org' );
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `accept` method can be used to specify the content type that your
application is expecting in response:

<Tabs groupId="use-preference">
  <TabItem value="framework" label="Framework Use" default>
    ```php
    Http::accept( 'text/plain' )->post( 'https://example.org' );
    Http::accept_json()->post( 'https://example.org' );
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Standalone Use">
    ```php
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

    Factory::create()->accept( 'text/plain' )->post( 'https://example.org' );
    Factory::create()->accept_json()->post( 'https://example.org' );
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Authentication

You can specify basic authentication and bearer token credentials with built-in
helper methods:

<Tabs groupId="use-preference">
  <TabItem value="framework" label="Framework Use" default>
    ```php
    Http::with_basic_auth( 'username', 'password' )->post( 'https://example.org' );

    // Passed as Authorization: Bearer <value>
    Http::with_token( '<value>' )->post( 'https://example.org' );
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Standalone Use">
    ```php
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

    Factory::create()->with_basic_auth( 'username', 'password' )->post( 'https://example.org' );

    // Passed as Authorization: Bearer
    Factory::create()->with_token( '<value>' )->post( 'https://example.org' );
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Timeout

The `timeout` method may be used to specify a maximum number of seconds to wait
for a response. The default is 5 seconds:

<Tabs groupId="use-preference">
  <TabItem value="framework" label="Framework Use" default>
    ```php
    Http::timeout( 10 )->post( 'https://example.org' );
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Standalone Use">
    ```php
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

    Factory::create()->timeout( 10 )->post( 'https://example.org' );
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Retries

If you would like HTTP client to automatically retry the request if a client or
server error occurs, you may use the `retry` method. The `retry` method accepts
the maximum number of times the request should be attempted and the number of
milliseconds that Mantle should wait in between attempts:

<Tabs groupId="use-preference">
  <TabItem value="framework" label="Framework Use" default>
    ```php
    Http::retry( 3 )->post( 'https://example.org' );
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Standalone Use">
    ```php
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

    Factory::create()->retry( 3 )->post( 'https://example.org' );
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Error Handling

By default, errors will be handled and converted into a
`Mantle\Http_Client\Response` object. This includes `WP_Error` objects that are
returned by WordPress. No exceptions are thrown by default.

Optionally, you can opt for an exception to be thrown if an error occurs:

<Tabs groupId="use-preference">
  <TabItem value="framework" label="Framework Use" default>
    ```php
    try {
      Http::throw_exception()->post( 'https://example.org' );
    } catch ( \Mantle\Http_Client\Http_Client_Exception $e ) {
      // Handle the exception.
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Standalone Use">
    ```php
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

    try {
      Factory::create()->throw_exception()->post( 'https://example.org' );
    } catch ( \Mantle\Http_Client\Http_Client_Exception $e ) {
      // Handle the exception.
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Responses

The HTTP client will return an instance of `Mantle\Http_Client\Response`, which
provides a flexible wrapper on top of the raw WordPress HTTP API response.

```php
$response->body(): mixed
$response->client_error(): bool
$response->collect( $key = null ): \Mantle\Support\Collection
$response->cookie( string $name ): ?\WP_HTTP_Cookie
$response->cookies(): array
$response->dd()
$response->dump()
$response->failed(): bool
$response->feed(): \SimplePie
$response->forbidden(): bool
$response->header( string $header )
$response->headers(): array
$response->is_blob(): bool
$response->is_feed(): bool
$response->is_file(): bool
$response->is_json(): bool
$response->is_wp_error(): bool
$response->is_xml(): bool
$response->json( $key = null, $default = null )
$response->object()
$response->ok(): bool
$response->redirect(): bool
$response->response(): array
$response->server_error(): bool
$response->status(): int
$response->successful(): bool
$response->unauthorized(): bool
$response->xml( string $xpath = null, $default = null )
```

The `Mantle\Http_Client\Response` object also implements the `ArrayAccess`,
allowing you to access JSON/XML response properties directly on the response.

```php
return Http::get( 'https://httpbin.org/json' )['slideshow'];
```

### Inspecting Responses

#### Client Error Status Code

The `client_error()` method will return `true` if the response status code is
between `400` and `499`:

```php
use Mantle\Facade\Http;

Http::get( 'https://httpbin.org/status/404' )->client_error();
```

#### Failed Status Code

The `failed()` method will return `true` if the response status code is between
`400` and `599`:

Http::get( 'https://httpbin.org/status/500' )->failed();
```

#### Forbidden Status Code

The `forbidden()` method will return `true` if the response status code is
`403`:

```

#### Response response(): array

#### Response Body

The `body()` method will return the response body as a string. If the response
is JSON or XML, the `json()` and `xml()` methods can be used to parse the body
into a PHP array or object:

$response = Http::get( 'https://httpbin.org/json' )->body();
```

#### Response Cookie

The `cookie()` method will return a single cookie from the response:

```php
use Mantle\Facade\Http;

$cookie = Http::get( 'https://httpbin.org/cookies' )->cookie( 'foo' );
```

#### Response Cookies

The `cookies()` method will return an array of all cookies from the response:

```

## Base API Client

The HTTP Client can be used as a basis for a API Client for an external service.
For example, if you are making requests to `https://httpbin.org` and want to
include built-in authentication, you could extend `Mantle\Http_Client\Factory`
and implement a `new_pending_request` method:

```php
use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;
use Mantle\Http_Client\Pending_Request;

class HttpBinClient extends Factory {
  protected function new_pending_request(): Pending_Request {
    return ( new Pending_Request() )
      ->base_url( 'https://httpbin.org' )
      ->with_token( '<token>' );
}
```

This is a great pattern to use when creating clients for different APIs. Because
it extends `Factory`, your IDE will also pick up all the methods available to
the client. Let's see an example of using the `HttpBinClient` class:

```php
// Make a POST request to https://httpbin.org/example-endpoint
$request = HttpBinClient::create()->post( '/example-endpoint', [
  'name' => 'Mantle Http Client',
] );
```

## Middleware

Requests can have middleware applied to them to allow the request and the
response to be modified. One use case is to calculate a checksum header based on
body of the request and pass that along with the request:

```php
use Closure;
use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

$client = Factory::base_url( 'https://api.github.com' )
  ->middleware( function ( Http_Client $client, Closure $next ) {
    $client->with_header( 'Authorization', md5( $client->url() . $client->body() ) );

    // You can also run the callback and then modify the response.
    return $next( $client );
  } );
```

## Caching

Requests can be cached using the `cached` method. The method can be used when
chaining together your HTTP request:

```php
use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

$response = Factory::create()->cached()->get( 'https://example.org' );
```

The `cached` method accepts a single argument of the number of seconds to
cache the response for. It also supports a `DateTime` object and defaults to one
hour:

```php
use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

$response = Factory::create()
  ->cached( now()->addDay() )
  ->get( 'https://example.org' );
```

Purging the cache can be done using the `purge` method:

```php
use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

Factory::create()->url( 'https://example.org' )->purge();
```

### Flexible Caching (SWR)

By default, when a cached response expires the HTTP Client will make a new
request and return the new response. If you would like to return the stale
cached response while a new request is made in the background, you can use
flexible caching (a pattern known as SWR - Stale While Revalidate).

Stale While Revalidate will reuse the stale cached response while a new request
is made in the background. This can be useful when you want to ensure that your
application is always responsive, even if the external service is slow or
unavailable. The new request will be made after the page has been sent to the
browser, so it won't impact the user experience.

To use SWR caching, use the `cache_flexible()` method:

```php
use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

use function Mantle\Support\Helpers\now;

$response = Factory::create(
  ->cache_flexible(
    stale: now()->addMinutes( 30 ),
    expire: now()->addHours( 3 ),
  )
  ->get( 'https://example.org' );
```

The `cache_flexible` method accepts two arguments:

- `stale`: The amount of time to keep the cached response stale. Accepts a
  number of seconds or a `DateTime` instance.
- `expire`: The amount of time to keep the cached response before it is
  considered expired. Accepts a number of seconds or a `DateTime` instance.

Here is an example of passing a number of seconds to the `cache_flexible`
method:

```php
use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

$response = Factory::create()
  ->cache_flexible(
    stale: HOUR_IN_SECONDS, // 1 hour
    expire: DAY_IN_SECONDS, // 24 hours
  )
  ->get( 'https://example.org' );
```

## Concurrent Requests (HTTP Pooling)

Sometimes, you may wish to make multiple HTTP requests concurrently. In other
words, you want several requests to be dispatched at the same time instead of
issuing the requests sequentially. This can lead to substantial performance
improvements when interacting with slow HTTP APIs.

Thankfully, you may accomplish this using the `pool` method. The `pool` method
accepts a closure which receives an `Mantle\Http_Client\Pool` instance,
allowing you to easily add requests to the request pool for dispatching:

<Tabs groupId="use-preference">
  <TabItem value="framework" label="Framework Use" default>
    ```php
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Pool;
    use Mantle\Facade\Http;

    $responses = Http::pool( fn ( Pool $pool ) => [
        $pool->get( 'http://localhost/first' ),
        $pool->post( 'http://localhost/second' )->with_json( [ 'name' => 'Mantle' ] ),
        $pool->get( 'http://localhost/third' ),
    ] );

    return $responses[0]->ok() &&
      $responses[1]->ok() &&
      $responses[2]->ok();
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Standalone Use">
    ```php
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Pool;
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

    $responses = Factory::create()->pool( fn ( Pool $pool ) => [
        $pool->get( 'http://localhost/first' ),
        $pool->post( 'http://localhost/second' )->with_json( [ 'name' => 'Mantle' ] ),
        $pool->get( 'http://localhost/third' ),
    ] );

    return $responses[0]->ok() &&
      $responses[1]->ok() &&
      $responses[2]->ok();
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

As you can see, each response instance can be accessed based on the order it was
added to the pool. If you wish, you can name the requests using the `as` method,
which allows you to access the corresponding responses by name:

<Tabs groupId="use-preference">
  <TabItem value="framework" label="Framework Use" default>
    ```php
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Pool;
    use Mantle\Facade\Http;

    $responses = Http::pool( fn ( Pool $pool ) => [
        $pool->as( 'first' )->get( 'http://localhost/first' ),
        $pool->as( 'second' )->get( 'http://localhost/second' ),
        $pool->as( 'third' )->get( 'http://localhost/third' ),
    ] );

    return $responses['first']->ok() &&
      $responses['second']->ok() &&
      $responses['third']->ok();
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Standalone Use">
    ```php
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Pool;
    use Mantle\Http_Client\Factory;

    $responses = Factory::create()->pool( fn ( Pool $pool ) => [
        $pool->as( 'first' )->get( 'http://localhost/first' ),
        $pool->as( 'second' )->get( 'http://localhost/second' ),
        $pool->as( 'third' )->get( 'http://localhost/third' ),
    ] );

    return $responses['first']->ok() &&
      $responses['second']->ok() &&
      $responses['third']->ok();
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Pooled requests can use any of the methods available on the HTTP Client, such as
`with_headers()`, `with_token()`, `timeout()`, as well as `cache()` and
`cache_flexible()` for caching responses.

## Testing Http Client

The Mantle Http Client was built using WordPress' built-in HTTP API. This means
that it can be tested using [Mantle's Remote Request](../testing/remote-requests.md)
testing functionality.
